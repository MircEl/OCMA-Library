OCMA TFT Library for Arduino

This library enables an Arduino board to communicate with the OCMA320240t350-A screen. 
It allows one to drawing shapes, lines, images, and text to the screen and to control the
touch panel and flags for the screen. 

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Please use at your own risk.


How to use:
Connect display pin 1 and 2 to ground, display pins 7 and 8 to VCC (5V).
Connect display pin 3 (RX) to TX of the arduino, and display pin 4 (TX) to RX of the arduino.
Optional - display pin 5 is a falling edge interrupt for when te touchscreen is pressed in touchMode 1. You will need to program this interrupt yourself and call OCMA::touchRead() function.

Initialize the screen with OCMA::init(baudrate) - not necessary, but this will reset the screen. You will not be able to send commands to the screen if the arduino baudrate does not match the display baudrate. This command will match the baudrates.

COMMANDS:

#1
void init(uint32_t baudr) 
Description: initializes and resets the screen at the specified baudrate.
available baud rates: 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 56000, 57600, 115200.
The other baudrates are commented out in OCMA.cpp, uncomment them if you have a newer version of the screen.

This command will match the baudrate of the arduino to the screen, and will send the command to change the baudrate to the one selected. It will reset the screen variables and display a black picture.
It takes a couple of seconds to initialize.
What it does:
-finds the screen baudrate, and changes it to the specified value
-sets cursor position to 0, 0
-sets write color to white and background color to black
-sets text background color to black
-sets touchpanel mode to 1
-sets scan mode to 1
-sets text size to 2
-sets text mode to 1
-sets brightness to 255
-clears the screen

#2
uint32_t showBaud(void)

Will scan the baudrates and will match arduino baudrate to screen baudrate. Will return an uint32_t value of the baudrate.

#3
void clearScreen(void)

Will clear the screen to the selected background color.

#4.0
uint16_t color(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b)
This function will return a usable color format used by the display. (red - 5 bits, green - 6 bits, blue - 5 bits).
Use this command to facillitate color selection.
Maximum values are:
red, blue - 31
green - 63
Everything higher will be clamped.

Example: tft.stroke(color(31, 0, 0)); - sets the stoke color to red.

#4
void stroke(uint16_t color)

Will change the color of drawing. Next command will draw with the specified color. Color (16 bit) RRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB.
You can use color(r,g,b) to transform the RGB values to the 16 bit the screen accepts.

#4.1
void stroke(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b)

Same as tft.stroke(tft.color(r, g, b));

#5
void background(uint16_t color)

Will change the drawing background color. Your next commands will use this color as background.

#5.1
void background(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b)

Same as tft.background(tft.color(r, g, b));

#6
void textSize(uint8_t size)

Will change the text size. Available sizes:
1 - 10x5 dot matrix ASCII
2 - 16x8 dot matrix ASCII
3 - 24x12 dot matrix ASCII
4 - 32x16 dot matrix ASCII

#7
void textMode(uint8_t mode)
void textMode(uint8_t mode, uint16_t bgcolor)

Will change the text mode. Available modes:
1 - without background color
2 - with background color bgcolor; if not specified, uses last value. init() will set bgcolor to black.

#8

#27
void calibrateTouchPanel(void)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOT TESTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!MIGHT REQUIRE COMPUTER SOFTWARE!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!
Will open touch panel calibration. The panel should be factory calibrated already. I have not tested it. Might screw up panel calibration without the PC software.

#28
void touchMode(uint8_t m)

Will change the touch mode of the panel. Touch modes:
1 - The touch panel status is uploaded when screen is called with touchRead() function. The pin 5 on the display will go low when panel is touched.
2 - The touch panel coordonates are uploaded as soon as screen is pressed. Use touchRead() to store the values.
3 - The touch panel will upload coordonates on touchscreen release.
4 - The touch panel will upload coordonates every 100ms. Might overflow the serial buffer if touchRead() is not used.
5 - The touch panel will upload coordonates on both when it is touched and released.

#29
void touchRead(void)

This command reads the touchscreen situation. It will save the touchpanel status (pressed or not - only in mode 1) and the coordonates of touch and release (in mode 1 only touch) and time of press and release in miliseconds (time when the function saved last press or last release cordonates)
If it is in mode 2,3,4,5, this command will save the first coordonates and status whic is in the serial buffer.

#30
uint16_t touchX(void)

This command will return:
in mode 1, 2, 4 - the x coordonates of last pannel touch
in mode 3 - the x coordonates of last panel release
in mode 5 - the x coordonates of the touch panel touch or release (whichever is latest)

#31
uint16_t touchY(void)
This command will return:
in mode 1, 2, 4 - the y coordonates of last pannel touch
in mode 3 - the y coordonates of last panel release
in mode 5 - the y coordonates of the touch panel touch or release (whichever is latest)

#32
uint32_t lastTouched(void)
This command will return the millis() of last saved coordonates x,y on screen press (which is called by touchRead()).
Will not work in mode 1.

#33
uint32_t lastReleased(void)
This command will return the millis() of last saved coordonates x,y on screen release (which is called by touchRead()).
Will not work in mode 1.

#34

Maximum id is 106. Everything higher than that will be clamped to 106.

#39
void saveScreen(uint16_t id)
Will save whatever is drawn on the screen to the display memory location id.
Maximum id is 106. Everything higher than that will be clamped to 106.
This takes some time!

#40
void drawCroppedImage(uitn16_t x, uint16_t y, uint16_t id, uint16_t ix, uint16_t iy, uint16_t w, uint16_t h)
This function will draw a cropped image from display memory location id, at coordonates x,y, where cropping starts at picture coordonates ix and iy, with width w and height h.
This command does not work on my older version of display, but maybe you will have some luck.

#41
void brightness(uint8_t b)
Sets screen backlight. 0 will turn it off, 1-255 will adjust the backligh level.

#42
void setScanMode(uint8_t scan)
Will rotate/mirror the display.
modes:
1 - normal mode
2 - mirrored mode
3 - 90 degrees rotation
4 - 90 degrees mirrored


//FOLLOWING COMMANDS DO NOT WORK ON MY DISPLAY AND MIGHT BE BUGGY
#43
void setWriteLayer(uint8_t layer)
The newer versions of the display have 2 "layers" in which you cand draw - this way you can reduce flicker, or "brush" aberations and also fade in between them.
Use this function to set the writing layer of the display.

#44
void setDisplayLayer(uint8_t layer)
Will set the display layer. Use 1 or 2.

#45
void setLayerTransparency(uint8_t transp)
This function will set opacity of the foreground layer (chosen by setDisplayLayer).
1 - 88%
2 - 75%
3 - 63%
4 - 50%

#46
void setFilteredDisplayLayer(uint16_t color)
Honestly I'm not sure exactly what this command will do as I cannot test it, and the datasheet is translated with Google Translate from chinese. Sorry.
Most probably will display layer 1 and apply an overlay filter with layer 2.

#47
void fadeLayers(uint16_t delay)
Will fade in between the layers with a set delay.
delay will adjust the speed of fading.
